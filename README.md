rails project to view, change and work in all databases and tables on one postgresql server.

this projects is a case study how to switch db connections on demand and work in a new connection. all connections will be caches so the performance when connecting more than once becomes much better.

you connect first to a database and you are using the same credentials for connecting to all the other databases on this db server.

this first release is just a case study.
